The PaymentChannel class is used to interact with a payment channel on the Filecoin network. A payment channel is a way for two parties to transact with each other off-chain, without the need for multiple on-chain transactions. Instead, they create a payment channel and deposit some funds into it. Then they can make multiple transactions off-chain, updating the balance of the payment channel each time. Once they are done, they settle the payment channel on-chain and the final balance is distributed according to the agreed terms.

The PaymentChannel class provides methods to create a new payment channel, load an existing payment channel, settle a payment channel, and collect funds from a settled payment channel. It also provides getters to access the payment channel's address and the addresses of the sender and receiver.

To use the PaymentChannel class, you need to provide the necessary information such as the RPC connection used to interact with the network, the sender and receiver addresses, and account data required to sign and broadcast transactions. You can then use the methods provided by the class to perform various actions on the payment channel, such as settling or collecting funds.
