Just run the following command to add the package to your project

```bash copy
yarn add @zondax/izari-filecoin
```
or
```bash copy
npm install --save @zondax/izari-filecoin
```

### Use
The package can be imported easily on any place you need it. Choose the way to import it based on the loader module you use.

For ESM modules
```typescript
import { Wallet, Transaction, Account } from "@zondax/izari-filecoin"
```

For CommonJS modules
```typescript
const { Wallet, Transaction, Account } = require("@zondax/izari-filecoin")
```

**Notes**

The `tests/jest` folder is a great place to understand more about each one of the available features, and have a sense on how to
use them. Besides, if you are interested in one particular environment, like NodeJS or React, `tests/package` can have the answer
you are looking for. Please, give them a chance!

### Specific features
Inside this package there are several entry points grouped by features. If you only need to use specific features among all others, please choose the entry point you want to import from

| Entry point                          | Features                    |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `@zondax/izari-filecoin`             | All features                |
| `@zondax/izari-filecoin/rpc`         | Node Communications         |
| `@zondax/izari-filecoin/address`     | Address                     |
| `@zondax/izari-filecoin/transaction` | Transaction                 |
| `@zondax/izari-filecoin/wallet`      | Wallet                      |
| `@zondax/izari-filecoin/account`     | Account                     |
| `@zondax/izari-filecoin/artifacts`   | Types, constants and errors |
| `@zondax/izari-filecoin/payment`     | Payment Channel             |

## Requisites
- NodeJS >= 16.0.0
- Native BigInt support (or global polyfill)

**Notes**
- Izari-Filecoin is not using native BigInt implementation internally. However, some dependencies are, and that is why it is required. One of them is `cborg`, which is used by `@ipld/dag-cbor`.

### React
- In order to use this package in browsers (like react, react-native, etc), some modules need to be polyfill (like Buffer, stream, etc). Most projects use
webpack to bundle JS code.  If your project uses it, please refer to [this](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvefallback) doc in order to configure it correctly.
Besides, you could check [this blog post](https://viglucci.io/articles/how-to-polyfill-buffer-with-webpack-5) too.
