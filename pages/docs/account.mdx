This class contains functions that allow you to work with cryptocurrency accounts. The send function is used to transfer funds from one account to another, and the getBalance function is used to get the current balance of a specific account.

The send function requires you to specify the RPC connection used to interact with the network, the account data of the sender, the address of the receiver, and the amount of cryptocurrency you want to transfer. It then creates a new transaction and signs it using the sender's account data, and broadcasts the transaction to the network. The function returns the ID of the transaction that was broadcast.

The getBalance function requires you to specify the RPC connection used to interact with the network and the account data of the account whose balance you want to check. It then fetches the current balance of that account from the network and returns it.
